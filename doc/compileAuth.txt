# compiling with authorization, on authorization branch
git checkout authorization

# requires libjwt, for json web token support,
# which requires jannson, for json support

sudo apt-get install git  build-essential make autoconf libtool libssl-dev pkg-config libjwt-dev

sudo apt-get install libjwt-dev libjansson-dev

# ....or
#
#put jansson-2.12 ,maybe also  libjwt-1.10.1 , in ringserver dir
# wget http://www.digip.org/jansson/releases/jansson-2.12.tar.gz
#tar zxf jansson-2.12.tar.gz
### jansson
#cd jansson-2.12
#./configure
#make
# sudo make install (to install into /usr/local)

### libjwt (note this is version 1.15.3 NOT 1.10.1)
# wget https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt/releases/download/v1.15.3/libjwt-1.15.3.tar.gz
# tar xzf libjwt-1.15.3.tar.gz
# cd libjwt-1.15.3
# autoreconf -i (might need to install autoreconf)
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install

# to ensure that the build and install process was correct
# ls /usr/local/include should output jansson.h and jwt.h

# before running ./ringserver, we may need to update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directory of the new dependency libraries
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# you may want to put that in your bashrc

# libcurl (required by https request)
1. download from github release into dir: https://github.com/curl/curl/releases/tag/curl-8_1_1
    $ wget https://github.com/curl/curl/archive/refs/tags/curl-8_1_1.tar.gz
2. Build curl, follow: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/GIT-INFO (no need to run autoreconf)
	1. ./configure --with-openssl
	2. make
	3. sudo make install
3. Check that it's installed via: ls /usr/local/include which should show curl


# to test:
edit ringserver conf file add
AuthDir your/auth/directory
which should contain your secret as
secret.key, paste your brgy token here (from AuthServer)
also add AuthServer link in config file for example: AuthServer http://172.22.0.3:5000/accounts/verifySensorToken

#use slink2dali with auth option:
TOKEN=paste_citizen_token
./slink2dali -vvv -a $TOKEN -S GE_TOLI2 geofon.gfz-potsdam.de:18000 localhost:18000
